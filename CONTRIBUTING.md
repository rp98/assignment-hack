## 🤗 Hello First-time Contributors

There are lot of resources (articles, courses, videos) available for getting started with git and GitHub you can search and follow any of the resource you like.

- If you feel like it needs extra feature or if you find bug, you can create your own issue.
- You can drop a comment on issue saying "Hi Rishank, let me work on this or I will kill you 🔪" to avoid multiple people working on the same PR.

Lastly, It is fine if you mess something up. If there is anything wrong in the PR I will let you know how to fix that in comments of the PR.
